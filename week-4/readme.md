## Complete the following tasks.

1. Word Count: Write a PHP script that takes a string as input, and returns the number of words in the string. You can assume that words are separated by spaces. Bonus points for excluding common punctuation marks from being counted as part of a word.

2. Palindrome Checker: Write a PHP script that takes a string as input and returns true if the string is a palindrome (a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards), and false otherwise.

3. String Reversal: Write a PHP script that takes a string as input and returns a new string with the characters in reverse order. For example, if the input string is "hello", the output should be "olleh".
